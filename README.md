# quantum

I'm working through the textbook book [Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists](http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-Computer-Scientists-Yanofsky/dp/0521879965), and loosely building up a library that I can use to solve the excercises. I'm not a physicist or a mathemitician, so I'm sure my library will end up incomplete, inefficient, and in some cases probably wrong. So don't like, use it for actual quantum computing.
